## Main method to research

bootstrap -- resampling approach -- estimate the uncertainty

1. find estimated theta
2. use boostrap to estimate se of theta
3. calculate the expectation of estimate of se of theta

1. how to use bootstrap to find uncertainty
2. learn how to use splines 2 in R via reading the paper

## Things to do next time:
1. set up a repo via github √
https://github.com/GordonYi/Bootstrap_Research

2. Know how to set up a simulation via bootstrap √
se_boot <- rep(NA, 1000)
for (i in 1:1000) {
      boot_sample <- sample(fitted_value, replace = TRUE)
      fitted_boot <- mean(boot_sample)
      se_boot[i] <- sd(boot_sample) / sqrt(length(boot_sample))
      }
 mean_se_boot <- mean(se_boot)
 
 Bootstrap_SE <- mean_se_boot
 

3.  Write down the outline of the research √

## Progress:
Some functions must be shape-restricted because of natural intuitions and prior knowledge. Some shape-restricted functions examples: Monotone Regressions, Convex Regressions... 

e.g. growth curves in population health, dose-response models in phase I clinical trials, and utility functions in economics

mainly about non-decreasing curve

A non-decreasing curve can be fitted by a linear combination of I-splines with an additional intercept where the coefficients of the I-spline basis functions are constrained to be nonnegative

**quardratic programming
What is that?
I do need to know how this works, MLE will not apply when the estimator is on the boundary**

We want to do least square to fit the I-splines regression, which contains several intervals, which means several betas, since we want the regression to be monotonically increasing, we want the beta in every intervals be non-negative (I'm not very sure about this, but I guess this is the reason)

And while we fitted the regression, we want to test that can bootstrap do a good job in estimating Standard Error with the shape-restricted regression:

So first we extract the fitted value from our regression, and do a bootstrap,
than we use the formula of Standard Error to see the real standard error, and compare them.
According to the dataset given by the paper, I did a I-splines regression(with df = 6), and apply bootstrap with it, find out the value of SE it given is very close to the SE value given by the formula.

## Questions:
1. Due to time limitation, I'm still not very farmiliar with the mathematical details behind those methods, which will be a hinder of the paper writting, will learn more by reading more
2. I am not very sure about what is the SE I need to deal with -- I did a bootstrap for the fitted value given by the non-negative I-spline function, but not sure while is it the right thing to do
3. And shape-restricted regression should be 
## Things to do: 
We want to construct CI for the f(t) over all t 

did the bootstrap on the original data,

get the bootstrap copy of the data,

coefficients are on the boundary so we can't get SE directly,

take 10 values equally spaced from the lowest to the highest,

(How to get that?)

get f^(t) by the function,

we have 10 time points

suppose the range is from 0 to 10 -- i look at the time estimation from 0 to 10

repeat this process B = 100 times,

100 by 10 matrix,

got 1000 values for each quantity,

do a 95% CI for them, and I got 1 interval,

is it really a 95% interval?

do a simulation study, need to have a model, if the fitted model is the true model, generated r = 1000 dataset from the distribution, 

See whether 95% of the intervals cover the truth value

To see whether in what situation this interval make sense and some situations are not.

In this setting, you will check how many of the bootstrap CI really covers the real value.

Set this up in the repo, every meeting record will be inside it.

## Outline of the Research:
1. Introduction
Background of Shape-Restricted Regression
Importance of estimate SE for Shape-Restricted Regression
2. Methods do this 1st
Introduce how to fit a shape-restricted regression 
Introduce how to use bootstrap for the given function
3. Examples
Give out some examples of data while use bootstrap we get a good SE
4. Conclusion

## Bootstrap Meeting 2

The thinking is wrong

I need to do a bootstrap sampling, and I get 205 values,

and I fit a function by the values, 

and I get the coefficients,

and I use this coefficients to get f(20),f(30).. I need 10 values,

and I need to use those values get CIs

Questions:
1. What is quadratic programming?
2. Did the bootstrap out and make those CIs

Progress:
Need to go outside with my friend tonight! Update after this!!
