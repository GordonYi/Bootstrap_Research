Progress:

1. Write down the first manuscript

2. Did the simulation study (Time-Repeat = 1000, n_bootstrap = 1000)
result is inside manuscript

3. Fix the x generate value problem, now x is generated by randomly
pick 1000 values repeatly. x <- runif(1000, min = 0, max = 30) 

Question:

1. Actually I did three functions, y = 0.25*(x-0.9) returns good result,
but the other two has some problems in the middle...

Progress:

1. Did the I-Spline regression for the age.income data

2. Did the bootstrap sampling and the 95% CI for a certain dataset

3. To find out that while bootstrap is a good method to check variation in
shape restricted regressions, do a simulation study to see wheather 95% CIs
generated by bootstrap can include 95% data

Procedure:

Let me describe the process of this simulation study first, to see wheather
what I am doing is right or not

1. First of all I define a function, let's say I define a function 
y = 0.25*(x-0.9) -- which is the first function from the reference paper

2. To ensure shape restricted (monotone in this situation), we want to fit 
an i-spline regression

3. Add some noise in the true function to simulate the dataset 
(I choose to add up noise by standard normal mean = 0, sd = 0.1) -- 
noise <- rnorm(num_points, mean = 0, sd = 0.1)

Note: I generate dataset by x <- seq(0, 30, by = 0.1) which means 300 data 
for each dataset

2. Second I decide ten certain time points(let's say all the 
integers from 1 to 10) as x and find out their y value

3. I want to add up some noise to those y values in certain time points, 
the noise is also rnorm(num_points, mean = 0, sd = 0.1)

4. I do a bootstrap sampling for 1000 times to find out one 95% CI for 
each time points

5. See wheather those CIs are true 95% CIs, we want to see that 
wheather 95% of those data points we generate by add up the noise to the real value
are inside the CI.



It seems not qualify to use this method! (but the reference success, 
I am checking out why this happend) It seems like the bootstrap CIs 
are abnormally way too small, maybe my method is wrong

For each three functions, if we increase the number of bootstrap 
sampling, we will get a much better result, I tried n_bootstrap = 2000

Question:

1. I want to generate noises by normal distributions but what is the 
parameters of this distribution?(Standard normal? mean = 0, sd = 0.1?)

2. Figuring out the problem on function 3

3. If I am not wrong, the coverage of CI is depend on the bootstrap 
sampling, and wheather those y(t)+noise are fit inside or not is 
depend on the noise, which means sometimes the result
might get wrong because we don't know what will be the value of 
next noise(but if the mean = 0, the mean of all of these noise 
will be 0? Which might means we will always get 95% of the data
inside the CIs? but it seems the truth is not like that?)

4. If the bootstrap method is stable enough to get 95% CI at 
all certain points, it means that bootstrap is a valid method 
to estimate uncertainty in shape-restricted senerio? Is that right?

On progressing, let's see what I can do until Monday!!!

What are we doing:

I dont know what the truth it

In a simulation study, I will generate the data and my true 
values will be known:

1. define a monotone function -- smooth, monotone function , 
use this function as a true μ(t) -- the expectation of y(t), 
use this to  generate the dataset 1000 times, 
and then add some noise

y = ax + bx^2 + c

generate some t whatever it value is

use normal distribution for the noise

Repeat the process 1000 times, the percentage of the truth value

y = μ(t) + noise

I need to know t first, and then i know μ(t),

and I generate y by setting the noise to normal(some variance 
of normal, variance is unchange),

my goal is to estimate μ(t)

put my bootstrap inside this setting to check is that real a 95% CI

suppose I have 5 time points, at every time point we want to 
check what is the empirical coverage of those CI,

at least 95% time inside 1000 times are inside the CI

look at what CI really is

Progress:

1. Rewrite the code to correct the error

2. Clean the Repo!

What are we doing:

Fit the Splines regression for the data in Semipar

Do the bootstrap sampling for n = 1000 times, find out the 95% CI 
for 10 time points inside the regression

Things need to solve: do a simulation study, find out wheather 
those simulated points are dropped inside the confidence intervals

Do it 1000 times, find out how many of those points are inside the CI

Question：

I think I did those things right and I think the next step is to 
do the simulation study, and I am thinking about that

Questions:

1. About regression fitting: I think the code I found from the
resource is somehow not appropriate, but I don't know how to fix that:

I use the code from the paper you gave me to do the splines 
regression fitting:(This part of the code is copied from the paper)

While we can see that the fitted regression is not inside the
data points, so I think the code inside the paper is wrong

2. How to do simulation study

I am sorry about that, but I can't find a good resource online to do a simulation study,

I don't understand what is "give out a signal to the 
original data to do the simulation study"

Please give me a resource to do that

Trying to estimate standard error in those 10 points

Should I repeat this process for 1000 times, to see wheather 
in >95% situations those CIs are covering the true value?

I tried to repeat it 1000 times, everytime the 95% CI 
(generated by the bootstrap) will cover the true value generated 
by the true data function

Is it prove that bootstrap is a good way to do estimation 
in this situation?

cover_true_count

1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000

cover_false_count

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In 1000 simulation studies, every bootstrap CIs covers the 
true value generated by the iSpline function

Which proves bootstrap is a good way to do estimation in this iSpline situation

footnote:

age is generated by the 10th, 20th, 30th... percentile of the dataset

income is estimated by the iSpline function from the paper, 
which is a true value that generated by the iSpline regression

Lower and Upper boundaries are the 95% CI created by 1000 times 
bootstrap fitted regressions

All the true points generated by the original iSpline function 
are covered inside the 95% CI

SE are generated by the 1000 bootstrap resamplings

Question:

I estimate the CI by bootstrapping the data for 1000 times, and I 
can see that in every f(t) I choose, the CI of the bootstrap covers the real value,
which might indicate that bootstrap is a good method to predict 
f(t), and these intervals are truely 95% intervals, but this is not about Standard Error..?

Or can I say that since every true point falls within its 
corresponding confidence interval (CI), you can tentatively conclude that the Bootstrap 
standard error (SE) is reliable?

do a simulation study, need to have a model, if the fitted
model is the true model, generated r = 1000 dataset from the distribution

I think I might do this wrong, let me think about that

--- I tried repeat the thing I did for 1000 times, all the 
CIs are covering the true value

Some interesting findings:

CIs are longer on the bottom side and shorter for the upper side

The thinking is wrong

I need to do a bootstrap sampling, and I get 205 values,

and I fit a function by the values,

and I get the coefficients,

and I use this coefficients to get f(20),f(30).. I need 10 values,

and I need to use those values get CIs

Questions:
What is quadratic programming? (not that important)
Did the bootstrap out and make those CIs

Report for meeting 1

Progress:

Some functions must be shape-restricted because of natural 
intuitions and prior knowledge. Some shape-restricted functions examples: 
Monotone Regressions, Convex Regressions...

e.g. growth curves in population health, dose-response models 
in phase I clinical trials, and utility functions in economics

mainly about non-decreasing curve

A non-decreasing curve can be fitted by a linear combination of 
I-splines with an additional intercept where the coefficients of the 
I-spline basis functions are constrained to be nonnegative

We want to do least square to fit the I-splines regression, 
which contains several intervals, which means several betas, 
since we want the regression to be monotonically increasing,

we want the beta in every intervals be non-negative (I'm not
very sure about this, but I guess this is the reason)

And while we fitted the regression, we want to test that 
can bootstrap do a good job in estimating Standard Error with 
the shape-restricted regression:

So first we extract the fitted value from our regression,
and do a bootstrap,

than we use the formula of Standard Error to see the real standard error
, and compare them.

According to the dataset given by the paper, I did a I-splines
regression(with df = 6), and apply bootstrap with it, find out the value of SE it given is 
very close to the SE value given by the formula.

Questions:

Due to time limitation, I'm still not very farmiliar with 
the mathematical details behind those methods, which will 
be a hinder of the paper writting, 
will learn more by reading more
I am not very sure about what is the SE I need to deal with -- 
I did a bootstrap for the fitted value given by the non-negative 
I-spline function, 
but not sure while is it the right thing to do
And shape-restricted regression should be

quardratic programming
What is that?

I do need to know how this works, MLE will not apply when the 
estimator is on the boundary**

Things to do:

We want to construct CI for the f(t) over all t

did the bootstrap on the original data,

get the bootstrap copy of the data,

coefficients are on the boundary so we can't get SE directly,

take 10 values equally spaced from the lowest to the highest,

(How to get that?)

get f^(t) by the function,

we have 10 time points

suppose the range is from 0 to 10 -- i look at the time 
estimation from 0 to 10

repeat this process B = 100 times,

100 by 10 matrix,

got 1000 values for each quantity,

do a 95% CI for them, and I got 1 interval,

is it really a 95% interval?

do a simulation study, need to have a model, if the fitted 
model is the true model, generated r = 1000 dataset from 
the distribution,

See whether 95% of the intervals cover the truth value

To see whether in what situation this interval make 
sense and some situations are not.

In this setting, you will check how many of the 
bootstrap CI really covers the real value.

Set this up in the repo, every meeting record will be inside it.

Main method to research

bootstrap -- resampling approach -- estimate the uncertainty

find estimated theta

use boostrap to estimate se of theta

calculate the expectation of estimate of se of theta

how to use bootstrap to find uncertainty
